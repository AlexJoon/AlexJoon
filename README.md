I architect expressive agentic-search systems, multi-pass retrieval workflows, and structured API-driven extraction pipelines used across Columbia Business School and Neurovios AI Research.  
My work spans RAG system design, knowledge workflows, academic document intelligence, and scalable web service scaffolding.

Based in Monterey, California (SFO) and professionally working out of New York City.
